Several strategies can resolve jetifier transformation errors. Try these steps in order:

1. **Clean the project:** Run `expo prebuild --clean` to remove any potentially corrupt build files. Then try building again.

2. **Check `package.json` dependencies:** Examine your dependencies in `package.json`. Look for any packages that might be known to cause problems with jetifier. You can search for reported issues with these packages in Expo's community forums or on GitHub.

3. **Update or reinstall packages:** If you identify a problematic package, try updating it to the latest version using `npm install <package_name>@latest` or `yarn add <package_name>@latest`. If that doesn't work, try uninstalling and reinstalling it.

4. **Inspect Android build.gradle:** If the previous steps fail, you may need to manually adjust the `android/app/build.gradle` file.  Look for sections related to dependencies and see if you can identify any conflicts or problematic entries. Sometimes you might need to add exclusion rules to resolve specific conflicts. Example:
```gradle
dependencies {
    implementation('com.example:problematic-library:1.0.0') {
        exclude group: 'com.google.android.material', module: 'material' // Example exclusion
    }
}
```
5. **Update Expo and SDK:** Ensure that you're using the latest version of Expo CLI and the Expo SDK.  Run `expo upgrade` to check for updates.

6. **Invalidate Caches/Restart:**  Invalidate caches in your IDE (e.g., Android Studio) or restart your computer.  Sometimes, cached files can interfere with the build process.

Remember to rebuild the app after applying each step.
