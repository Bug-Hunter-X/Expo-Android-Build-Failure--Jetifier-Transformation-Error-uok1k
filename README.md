# Expo Android Build Failure: Jetifier Transformation Error

This repository demonstrates a common issue encountered when building Android apps with Expo CLI: Jetifier transformation errors.  These errors typically stem from dependency conflicts or issues with missing or corrupted libraries.

## Problem

The `jetifier` process, used by Expo to handle Android's support libraries, fails during the build process, resulting in a build failure.  The error message often indicates a specific library that `jetifier` couldn't transform.

## Solution

The solution often involves resolving dependency conflicts, cleaning the project, and potentially updating or reinstalling problematic libraries.  Sometimes, direct intervention with the `android/app/build.gradle` might be required.

## Steps to Reproduce (bug.js)

1.  Create a new Expo project.
2.  Introduce a problematic library with known jetifier compatibility issue (or a specific problematic dependency). (Illustrative code may be included in `bug.js` to show a project setup likely to cause the error).
3.  Try to build the Android app using `expo build:android`.

## Solution (bugSolution.js)

This file contains strategies to fix the problem such as:

1.  Cleaning the project: `expo prebuild --clean`
2.  Checking and adjusting dependencies in `package.json`.
3.  Manually editing `android/app/build.gradle` to resolve specific dependency issues (detailed steps and examples in bugSolution.js)
4.  Updating Expo and related packages (`expo upgrade`).

Note: The exact solution depends on the specific error message and problematic library.
